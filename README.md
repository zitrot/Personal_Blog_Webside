# Landing Page Project 1

# Introduction

This is the first assignment of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program. For this assignment, we were asked to make a blog with cards and a blog post. Using Flex and Grid features.

The blog contains and index (index.html) file for the starting page followed by other html file that represents the profile of the person to be accessed.

Included CSS files are index_style and blog_style for both the index and blog pages and a header, footer, and button style for individual components.
